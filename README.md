# SC1 Example Project

This is a simple, example R project.

If you knit the RMarkdown file in the doc/ directory it will produce an HTML file explaining how truncated singular value decompositions can be used to compress images.

The R code used is in the R/ directory, and the images are in the data/ directory.

It could take several minutes to knit. Using an optimized BLAS library for your system can reduce this significantly.
